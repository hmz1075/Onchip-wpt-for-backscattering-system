### Pakistan 1,2,3 Tapeout Projects
### 1)	Backscattering Integration for On-Chip Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) Receivers
### Introduction
Proposed project  implement WPT system having the capability of a passive backscattering using the single power transfer coils. The design goal of project will be to implement an on-chip resonant WPT system that capable of harvesting energy from external off chip coils, harvest the megnteic energy using an active recitifier and derive a load.
